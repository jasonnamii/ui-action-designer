# ui-action-designer

**Figma to HTML pipeline: extract design systems, author PRDs, generate actions and tasks, output 4-direction design proposals.**

## Goal

ui-action-designer bridges the design-to-development disconnect through an 8-phase pipeline: extract design systems, enable PRD authoring, extract actions and tasks, apply SHE filter, inject platform patterns, generate 4-direction proposals, and validate PRD consistency.

## When & How to Use

Deploy when you have a Figma design or concept that needs to become actionable specification and code. Pipeline: Design → DS extraction → PRD linking → Action-Task extraction → SHE filter → Knowledge injection → 4-direction proposals → HTML output.

## Use Cases

| Scenario | Prompt | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| Design handoff | `"Turn Figma design into PRD and 4 implementation directions"` | DS extraction→PRD→Actions/Tasks→SHE→4 proposals as HTML + consistency check |
| PRD update | `"Update PRD based on new design direction"` | Design delta→PRD update→re-extract tasks→4-direction proposals→validate |
| PRD from scratch | `"Author simple PRD for this component"` | Factor selection→PRD→DS extraction→4 proposals→HTML prototype |

## Key Features

- 8-phase pipeline: Input → DS extraction → Analysis → Action-Task → SHE → Knowledge → 4 proposals → HTML
- PRD authoring with factor selection (required/optional/nice-to-have)
- Action-Task hierarchy: Actions (functions) > Tasks (steps)
- SHE filter: Simple→Hide→Embody
- iOS/Material Design 3 pattern injection
- 4-direction proposals: Pragmatic, Elegant, Minimal, Feature-rich
- PRD consistency verification
